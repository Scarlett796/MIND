Jeff Dunkin of St Charles, Missouri, about 20 miles away from St Louis, captured the meteor on his doorbell camera as it descended toward Earth. Although the Northern Taurids meteor shower features a low number of visible meteors, approximately five per hour, some of them, known as fireballs, are spectacularly bright. The light pollution from large cities like St Louis can sometimes make meteor sightings difficult, but this particular meteor was bright enough to be seen all across the area. The next night for recommended meteor viewing is November 16 into the early morning of November 17, when the Leonids meteor shower might bring around 15 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.

Michael Jardine was at home in Avoca Beach on November 12 when he noticed ash and burned leaves falling from the hazy sky. He told Storyful, "Historically, where we are in Avoca, there have been no major issues with bushfires." Although largely unaffected by the fires, the closest of which was a two-hour drive away, Avoca Beach did close its public school on November 12. Jardine said he believed the debris seen in the video was blowing in from the Gospers Mountain fire, which had reached 35,000 hectares (about 86,500 acres) at that point. As of November 14, the NSW Rural Fire Service reported 61 fires were still burning across New South Wales, 35 of which were yet to be contained. The organization warned of an increased risk on November 15, with eight parts of the state classified as being under very high or severe fire danger. The national death toll from the catastrophic event has risen to four as firefighters battled blazes across two states. Credit: Michael Jardine via Storyful

The Times once again has shoehorned a poorly argued opinion story into their news section with this ridiculous headline quote: "Biden's attacks on Warren turn personal, drawing some complaints of sexism." Obvious questions begin to arise, of course, complaints from whom? What accusations exactly? They go on to explain that Biden's use of the term "Condescending, angry, or elitist" is somehow adopting a gendered trope. This is patently insane. Maybe Biden's use of the terms condescending, angry, or elitist come from the fact that Elizabeth Warren is actually quite condescending and elitist.

news	Krystal Ball: Billionaires panicking over Sanders candidacy	Opinion by: Krystal Ball At a grassroots fundraiser last night in D.C., Bernie Sanders had a message for our fragile ruling class. His utter mockery and 'F your feelings' attitude towards billionaires is just sublime and, of course, perfectly timed given that the ruling class is truly in full meltdown panic mode. First, Tom Steyer jumped into the presidential race after saying he wouldn't. When pressed for a justification by Politico, he said it's because no one was prioritizing climate change. This, of course, in spite of the fact that he still has investments in oil and gas companies, not to mention an undying faith in the consumerist capitalistic system that led the planet to the point of collapse in the first place. Then, after numerous reports of Manhattan donor hand wringing, Michael Bloomberg decided to get in on the action. He is now officially on the ballot in at least a few states and his advisor Howard Wolfson says that he will skip the early primary states to focus on Super Tuesday. The billionaire former NYC mayor would enter the primary race with a worst in field negative 31 favorability rating among Iowa voters. Next up, Deval Patrick who brings quite a record of white-washing corporate malfeasance to the table. He's got a classic up by the bootstraps story that ends with him as VP at Coca-Cola, VP at Texaco, and managing director at Bain Capital. But maybe his most revealing resume item was his time with Ameriquest, which was written about by Zach Carter over at the Huffington Post. Ameriquest was the largest subprime lender in the housing crisis. Described as the "worst bottom feeder of them all," Deval Patrick sat on their board. Patrick has called Biden and others to indicate he may jump in the race. I guess the donor class loves Pete but can see the polling that has him near 0% with black voters. I personally see no reason to believe that a similar corporatist background wrapped in a different identity will achieve significantly better results  but sure, whatever.

Koalas In Care Inc is a non-profit organisation and registered charity run by Christeen and Paul McLeod. 'Sootie' is one of 26 koalas   both adult and juvenile animals   currently being treated in a makeshift burns unit at the home in Taree. In a Facebook post on November 10, the charity posted a video of Sootie and wrote, "Adult male has been in a very hot area. 4 paws burnt, fur scorched, nose burnt, ears scorched. In shock and being treated for injuries." The following day, the charity posted a second video showing the koala eating leaves. "Lovely to see him wanting to eat, at this stage. Long way to go, but encouraging signs," Sootie's carer is heard saying. Paul McLeod told Storyful, "We are in overload at the moment. The fire situation is far from over and our township of Taree is in lockdown with the Rural Fire Service taking emergency control. "We would normally have a network of contacts who would get these animals to us but conditions are too dangerous at the moment, so we are relying on the public to notify us of animals in need. "We have been running for 27 years and get no government funding. We rely on public donations and our own fundraising to provide the necessary treatment and medications for our koala patients." New South Wales battled "catastrophic" fire conditions on November 12 with a state of emergency declared for large portions of the east coast. There were 55 fires burning across the state with half yet to be contained and nine burning at a 'watch and act' level. Credit: Koalas In Care via Storyful

Strong winds were preventing some waterbombers from reaching fires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Hot, windy and dry conditions sparked a significant increase in dangerous fire activity across the state's east coast since Friday, November 8. Three people had died and a number were missing while hundreds of properties were damaged as a result of the fires, authorities said.

Out-of-control fires were threatening homes near Kempsey, Tenterfield, Hillville, Nowendoc and Armidale, while two emergency-level blazes were impacting the Clarence Valley. Residents in some of the affected areas were told it was "too late to leave" and to protect themselves "from the heat of the fire" while others were ordered to evacuate immediately. Strong winds were preventing some waterbombers from reaching fires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Hot, windy and dry conditions sparked a significant increase in dangerous fire activity across the state's east coast since Friday, November 8. Three people had died and a number were missing while hundreds of properties were damaged as a result of the fires, authorities said.

When she was selected her three consonants it sounded like she asked for B-H-B. Sajak asked, "By the way, the third consonant was a D - Is that what you said? B-H-D?" To add to the confusion Evans said, "No, B." To which Sajak replied, "No, first one was B then you called an H." Eventually they got it sorted out, though it wasn't much help because there were no B's or D's in the puzzle. Regardless, fans at home were upset and took to Twitter to voice their frustration. While Evans didn't win the bonus puzzle, she did go home with $19,800 worth of prizes. So in the end it was a pretty good day...or bay, as Evans might say.

video	Terrifying moment wild elephant CRUSHES passing car on mountain road in Thailand	This is the terrifying moment a wild elephant crushed a passing car after refusing to let it drive by on a mountain road. The jumbo noticed the grey Toyota approaching on a bend in Nakhon Rathashima, northeastern Thailand, last Tuesday (October 29) afternoon. The large bull stomped over to the vehicle and kneeled on the bonnet before walking behind and laying its huge body across the rear windscreen. Shocked driver Phassakorn Niltarach was left cowering behind the steering wheel while the beast smashed the glass and dented the bodywork and damaged the mirrors. The vehicle eventually managed to move forward after the ordeal, lasting more than a minute. The woman who recorded the video is heard saying "are you crazy?" She then adds: ''You should have driven away earlier before the elephant had chance to do that." Speaking after, the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ''I was so shocked when the elephant walked to the car and I was even more surprised when the elephant tried to sit on that car. "It's lucky that the driver managed to get away safely. I want this to be an example because people should stay well away from the elephants. They might appear friendly but they could hurt you." Wildlife rangers in the Khao Yai National Park said that the elephant was a 35-year-old male named Deu. They warned drivers to take extra care when driving through the mountain roads, where elephants often roam. Park ranger Kanchit Sarinpawan said that elephants often venture out of the forest around October when the country's monsoon rainy season ends and the dry and cool period begins. The official reassured motorists that the elephant's behaviour was ''just his way of greeting tourists."

Out-of-control fires were threatening homes near Kempsey, Tenterfield, Hillville, Nowendoc and Armidale, while two emergency-level blazes were impacting the Clarence Valley. Residents in some of the affected areas were told it was "too late to leave" and to protect themselves "from the heat of the fire" while others were ordered to evacuate immediately. Strong winds were preventing some waterbombers from reaching fires, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Hot, windy and dry conditions sparked a significant increase in dangerous fire activity across the state's east coast since Friday, November 8. Three people had died and a number were missing while hundreds of properties were damaged as a result of the fires, authorities said. This footage shows a waterbomber dropping its load onto the Gulf Road fire which was burning out of control in the Tenterfield area, near Glen Innes. Credit: @heinekenheli via Storyful

The encroaching fires turned the sky red, as the Sydney Morning Herald reported there were 82 fires burning in the state. Of those, the Herald said, 16 were rated as "emergency level fires." Taree and other north coast areas were also under evacuation orders. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service confirmed an unknown number of homes and other buildings had been destroyed. The Daily Telegraph said there were fears for people who were trapped in their homes. The fires saw the Pacific Highway closed between Taree and Bulahdelah, and at Port Macquarie between the Oxley Highway and Hastings River Drive. The fires left the skies above Port Macquarie a reddish-orange, prompting a number of residents to film the eerie scene. Local woman Eliza Tetley captured footage here on November 8 and told Storyful it was filmed when the fire was "about 6 km away." She said the sky started "going red" at midday, "but there was smoke and burnt leaves falling all day." Several evacuation centers were set up, according to the New South Wales Police.
